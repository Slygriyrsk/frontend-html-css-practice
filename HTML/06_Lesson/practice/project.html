    <h1>What Can I Build With HTML and CSS?</h1>
    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are
    <br>the foundation of websites in that they provide structure and styling to a
    <br>web page. With HTML, you can add non-interactive elements such as text
    <br>and images, and include interactive elements such as links, buttons, and videos.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>CSS enables you to style a web page and make websites responsive. This is
    <br>possible with media queries, which were introduced in CSS3.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>(HTML is on its fifth iteration, so you wll see it referred to as HTML5, while CSS is on its third.)
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>Since the addition of media queries, it is possible to check the width and
    <br>height of the current device, as well as the orientation (landscape or
    <br>portrait). That means you can make a site mobile responsive using just these two languages.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>It is also possible to create animations using CSS by gradually changing an
    <br>element properties. And you can even create flashy scrolling effects (known as <strong><a href="https://keithclark.co.uk/">"Parallax").</a></strong>
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>While working on HTML and CSS practice projects can help you build
    <br>beautiful websites, for more complex sites, you would most likely want to
    <br>use JavaScript. With JavaScript, you can fetch data from a database, handle
    <br>different states of an application, and easily add interactive elements like a slider.
    </p>

    <p>
    <br>However, there is still a LOT you can do. Let us take a look at some great project ideas to try out.
